	  <p>Germany is one of Europe's largest nations, with one of the largest populations.
		 The area that now makes up Germany originally was a cluster of partially independent cities 		 and states. In 1871 the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck created a unified Germany.
		 After World War II, west part of German became the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) 		 while the east part became the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Germany was separated 		 for four decades. The two German nations were reunited on October 3, 1990.</p>

	  <p>Germany's main regions are the Bavarian Alps, the South German Hill Region, the Central 		 Uplands, and the North German Plain. Major rivers include the Rhine in the west and the Danube, 		 which flows from west to east. Germany has the second largest population of any European 		 countryâ€”over 81 million. More than 90 percent of the people are ethnic Germans, descended from 		 Germanic tribes. Since the 1950s, significant numbers of foreign workers have come into Germany 		 from countries including Turkey, Italy, Greece, and the former Yugoslavia.</p>

	  <p>About 30 percent of Germans belong to the official Protestant church. An estimated 28 percent 		 of the population is Catholic. The Protestants live mainly in the north, and the Catholics, in 		 the south. Other Christian denominations include Methodists, Baptists, Mennonites, and the 		 Society of Friends. Before the 1930s, Germany had a Jewish population of about 530,000. However, 		 the great majority fled or were killed by the government during World War II</p>
